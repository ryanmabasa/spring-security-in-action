For unit testing only

you find a comparison of how using annotations to define the test security environment 
differs from using a RequestPostProcessor. 
The framework interprets annotations such as @WithMockUser before it executes the test method. 
This way, the test method creates the test request and executes it in an already configured security environment. 
When using a RequestPostProcessor, the framework first calls the test method and builds the test request. 
The framework then applies the RequestPostProcessor, which alters the request or the environment in which itâ€™s executed before sending it. In this case, the framework configures the test dependencies, 
such as the mock users and the SecurityContext, after building the test request.
